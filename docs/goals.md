# Goals

## Glossary, Cross-references, Index, Drafts, comments

Keep this as simple and data-driven as possible, with minimal user
input!!!

Initially just get "something" running to see how *I* use it...

I need an (initially) simple infrastructure to create a web-based:

    - one app/front-end:
      - Glossary
    - Cross-references
    - Index

    - other app/front-end :
    - Drafts structure manager

  - other app/front-end :
    - comments (linked to drafts structure manager)

  - other app/front-end:
    - bibliographic references

### Drafts Structure Manager

The drafts structure manager should be driven by the
(supra)(latex)document structure. (Using LPiL-tool)

However, I may need to add information about how the document structure
maps from one draft to the next.

### Index, cross-references, Glossary

The index, cross-references should be extracted from the LaTeX document's
cross-references, and indexing tools. (Using LPiL-tool)

Again, I may need to add (a small amount of) information to link from one
draft to another.
